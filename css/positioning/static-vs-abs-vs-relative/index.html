    <h1>Static vs Absolute</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Static</h2>
      <div class="box static">static</div>
      <p>
        This box has <code>position: static</code> (default value). The element
        will be positioned according to the normal document flow, meaning it
        will occupy space in the layout without any adjustments from top, left,
        or other offset properties
      </p>
      <h2>Absolute with ancestor position: non relative</h2>
      <div class="box absolute">absolute</div>
      <p>
        The <code>position: absolute</code> element will position itself
        relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (non-static). If no such
        ancestor exists, it defaults to being positioned relative to the initial
        containing block (ICB), typically the root element.
      </p>

      <div class="container-relative">
        <h2>Relative container</h2>
        <p>
          This box has <code>position: relative</code>. The
          <code> left: 100px;</code> has made the container move to the right
        </p>
        <h3>Absolute with ancestor position: relative</h3>
        <div class="box absolute-relative">absolute</div>
        <p>
          The absolutely positioned element is now positioned relative to its
          nearest positioned ancestor (.container-relative).
        </p>
        <h3>
          Relative box with ancestor position: relative (relative positioned
          container)
        </h3>
        <div class="box relative">Relative</div>
        <p>
          This box is moved 100px from the top and 100px from the left of its
          original position within the .container-relative.
        </p>
      </div>
